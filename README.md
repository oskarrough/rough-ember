# Rough Ember

This is part of my quest to master front-end frameworks like Ember and Angular. Hopefully it can serve as a boilerplate for future projects with similar structure.

See http://oskarrough.github.io/rough-ember/ for a more or less working example.


## To-do

- Add a way to define meta <title> (See https://gist.github.com/machty/8413411)
- Refactor main.js
- Use ember-app-kit or similar to split the scripts into seperate files
- Find a proper restful server
- Find a way to render for SEO
